# covid19_analysis
A project on coronavirus analysis which has left the world in a grinding situation.<br/>
The data was pulled straight from John Hopkin's github repository where it is in the time series format, and is updated on a daily basis.<br/>
The data sets needed a whole lot of transformation and cleaning which you all can see in the notebook, along with the required documentation.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, the final data is visualised in Tableau, a data visualzation platform, where everyone can see the global cases in the world map along with the US cases date wise, till 21st of April.<br/>
